# Design Decisions

-   **Single Page App**
    -   Created the program as a (nearly) single page app. To get the feeling of a fast, high-end 8-bit game, nearly everything is in the single index.html file
    -   Why?
        -   Cartridge based games didn&#39;t not have any load times.
        -   Let&#39;s me load the whole game at once.
    -   How?
        -   The main div is id=main. Every section under it is a &quot;page&quot;.
        -   activateSection(); \&lt;-- hence the name
            -   By doing document.getElementById(&quot;main&quot;).children in a loop, and then setting each element as _display: none_, I can hide every part of the game I don&#39;t want to display.
            -   I can then activate just the one child I want to display.
        -   This gives the illusion of **instant load times**
    -   \*\* \*\* Exceptions
        -   Avatar upload part is in separate files.
        -   The level creator is in separate files. But this is inconsequential, due to the fact that the general user will never get to touch the level creator.
-   **Game Modes**
    -   All modes only play 3 levels
    -   **Arcade**
        -   I only account for not hitting the error limits in arcade mode. So I don&#39;t display the duration/time when that is completed.
    -   **Time Trial**
        -   If you beat all 3 levels in under 30 minutes, the time remaining will display. This fullfils requirement &quot;Part 1 #7&quot;
-   **Level Creator**

    -   The level creator can be found at [https://www.rivera-web.com/nonogram/level_creator.html](https://www.rivera-web.com/nonogram/level_creator.html)
    -   This is the only place where the random level creator can be used
    -   The level creator, while it can be used with a mobile device, is more suited for a desktop
    -   **You can also view the levels here to figure out how to beat the levels**

-   **High Scores**
    -   Where are they?
    -   Just don&#39;t touch anything after hitting &quot;start game&quot;, they will cycle automatically, just like an old arcade game.
    -   **I skipped the part where I change the order**. That didn&#39;t really make any sense for what I was going for, the style of an old arcade game. That is just a simple matter of running the array backwards in JS or doing a _select .. asc_ or _select .. desc_ in MySQL
    -   **I changed the score formula** to parseInt((Math.max(elementCount - errorCount, 0) / elementCount) \* 100,10); I believe it displays better. That way the highest score is 100, not 1.
-   **Trusting the Client**
    -   Because it was really outside of the scope of the project, I don&#39;t have much, if anything, in the way of preventing a savvy programmer from messing with their score, or other things.
    -   Things I could of done:
        -   The simplest thing would be to obfuscate the code.
            -   But this prevents the instructor from easily see what is going on
        -   I could of implemented server side timers and score keepers
            -   But this would required extra tables or file operations that are not spec&#39;d for this project.
    -   So I just didn&#39;t do anything.
-   **Image Uploads**

    -   The user avatar is client-to-server, stored for reuse.
    -   The &#39;upload&#39; for the levels is pure javascript, because I&#39;ve never done it that way before and I wanted to learn how to use it.
        -   Links to from sources is always volatile, but I still chose to do it, as an education exercise.

-   **Suggestion tool**
    -   So here&#39;s the thing. I don&#39;t really care for the game, and I&#39;m not good at it. The examples of suggestions from other games online don&#39;t really tell me much, and often times their suggestion didn&#39;t really help me.
    -   I wanted to make my tool better, but, I don&#39;t think I can. So what I did was ..
        -   Find a marked square
            -   Count squares around it that are unmarked. This is the most unique marked square, so it&#39;s useful.
        -   Find an unmarked square
            -   Count squares around it that are marked. This is the most unique unmarked square, so it&#39;s also useful.
    -   I made it just one suggestion per level
-   **Colors / Themes**
    -   Instead of using a color picker, I choose to use themes.
        -   Why?
        -   I want my game to look nice at all times.
        -   I hope it&#39;s appreciated that this method is harder than just a color picker.
-   **No Small Screens for 13x13**
    -   No mobile or any other small screens for 13x13. The game option will be hidden by CSS AND JS.
-   **Ending Credits**
    -   This is where I talk about myself and the game, as per requirement &quot; **Webpages must contain: # 5**&quot;
-   **Hacking the game**
    -   to skip actually playing the game, you can run some special functions
        -   **forceWin()**
            -   beat the current level
        -   **forceCredits()**
            -   beat the game
        -   **forceTimeout()**
            -   force the timer to runout early.
